# Uncommon Express.js Errors

This repository demonstrates two uncommon error scenarios in Express.js applications:

1. **Reverse Proxy Misconfiguration:** Incorrectly configured reverse proxies can prevent requests from reaching your Express app.
2. **Asynchronous Middleware Issues:** Improper handling of asynchronous operations in middleware can lead to race conditions and unexpected behavior.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
4. Run `node bug.js` to start the server with the bug.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` to start the server with the solution.

## Bug Scenarios and Solutions

The `bug.js` file contains code that demonstrates these uncommon errors.  `bugSolution.js` provides corrected code.

* **Reverse Proxy:** To replicate the error, set up a reverse proxy (like Nginx or Apache) and misconfigure the port forwarding or proxy pass settings. 
* **Async Middleware:**  The bug demonstrates how incorrect handling of async operations can produce unpredictable results. The solution introduces proper error handling and async flow control.
